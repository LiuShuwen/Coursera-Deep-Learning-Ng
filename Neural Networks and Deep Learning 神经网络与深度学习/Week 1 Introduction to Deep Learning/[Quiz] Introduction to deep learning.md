# Introduction to deep learning

1. *What does the analogy “AI is the new electricity” refer to?*

  - [ ] AI is powering personal devices in our homes and offices, similar to electricity.

  - [ ] AI runs on computers and is thus powered by electricity, but it is letting computers do things not possible before.

  - [ ] Through the “smart grid”, AI is delivering a new wave of electricity.

  - [x] Similar to electricity starting about 100 years ago, AI is transforming multiple industries.

  **Note:** See the `Video: Welcome` 1:27 s，Andrew illustrated that

  > AI is the new Electricity
  >
  > Electricity had once transformed countless industries: Transportation, manufacturing, healthcare, communications, and more
  >
  > AI will now bring about an equally big transformation.

2. *Which of these are reasons for Deep Learning recently taking off? (Check the three options that apply.)*

   - [x] We have access to a lot more data.
   - [x] We have access to a lot more computational power.
   - [x] Deep learning has resulted in significant improvements in important applications such as online advertising, speech recognition, and image recognition.
   - [ ] Neural Networks are a brand new field.

   **Note:** The digitalization of our society has played a huge role to make us accessible to a lot more data. The development of hardware, perhaps especially GPU computing, has significantly improved deep learning algorithms' performance. Online advertising, speech recognition, and image recognition were examples discussed in lecture 3.

3. *Recall this diagram of iterating over different ML ideas. Which of the statements below are true? (Check all that apply.)*

   - [x] Being able to try out ideas quickly allows deep learning engineers to iterate more quickly.
   - [x] Faster computation can help speed up how long a team takes to iterate to a good idea.
   - [ ] It is faster to train on a big dataset than a small dataset.
   - [x] Recent progress in deep learning algorithms has allowed us to train good models faster (even without changing the CPU/GPU hardware).

   **Note: **These concepts were discussed in Lecture 4. As for the third option, Andrew has discussed how switching from sigmoid to ReLU activation functions allows faster training.
